        <h1>Week 1</h1>
        <h2>04/02/20</h2>
        <p>The first lecture of Business Management gave me a holistic overview that investigated the module content that is being covered in the upcoming weeks, the assessments and the weighting of these. The module is split into group and individual work, where we will be expected to collaboratively produce a presentation and an individual report based upon the chosen organisation. This assessment will enable me to develop the relationships within my group, enhance my soft skills, which will enable me to use in my future career. </p>
        <p>The first lecture was interesting, we looked at the functions of a manager and identified skills that are learnt to become successful. Self-management was one of the discussion points within the lecture, it allowed me to identify my strengths and weaknesses and reflect on areas that will allow me to enhance employability and success within the assessment criteria. </p>
        <p>Having a fresh outlook of self-management has allowed me to reflect upon my own skills and attributes that will support me and my group for the assessment work. Group work is a vital skill to have within the workplace an ensuring that management is used effectively will be vital to ensure a successful output.</p>

        <h1>Week 2</h1>
        <h2>11/02/20</h2>
        <p>In this lecture we looked at the external factors that can implicate a business in positive and negative ways and we discussed competitive advantage and sustainability. To achieve this, we used PESTLE to identify the political, environmental, social, technological, legal and ethical factors that would have an impact on an organisation. </p>
        <p>In the lecture we carried out an exercise that looked at the impact PESTLE has on UWL identifying factors that would cause the university to change due to the adapting environment. I found this challenging because we had to have generalised ideas as there was not the opportunity for research. I discovered the impact on the free market and the implications of Brexit, which will help me in the upcoming weeks with the group assessment.</p>
        <p>In addition to this, we discussed in our groups about the organisation that we were going to research for the group assessment. I found this helpful because it gave me the opportunity to communicate with my group members to identify their strengths and weaknesses. </p>

        <h1>Week 3</h1>
        <h2>18/02/20</h2>
        <p>The learning outcomes for this lecture are to identify the management challenges within globalisation, the influence that it has and the benefits of global management. During the lecture we discussed these aspects as a group allowing us to understand the topics in detail and in relation to our businesses.</p>
        <p>Throughout the lecture we identified the different market entry strategies for organisations looking at globalisation and the steps in which they must follow to in order to adhere and respect culture and legislation that is apparent in different countries. McDonalds was the topic of this conversation and from this I learnt that as they are a global company, they change their food products to meet to requirements of the customers for example, changing to halal-based products as its part of the culture. </p>
        <p>There are several different strategies that organisations consider when thinking about globalisation these vary from legal and political systems, cultural differences, trade agreements and barriers as well as ensuring that they comply with ethical practices.</p>

        <h1>Week 4</h1>
        <h2>25/02/20</h2>
        <p>The outcome for week four was to understand and conduct SWOT analysis, to identify benefits and disadvantages of the analysis and to apply knowledge gained to a business of our choice, which will aid my individual assessment.</p>
        <p>We looked at the four different aspects of the analysis and broke down each element in detail so that we could further investigate the business of our choice. There are many factors that can be analysed for any business and Samsung provides a good example. Group discussion was prevalent throughout this lecture as sharing ideas and research helped with creating a SWOT for the chosen business. Factors that influence companies are similar and can be applied to businesses within the same industry.</p>
        <p>The most challenging aspect of this lecture was to find relevant information on the chosen company. Identifying the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats that are relevant can be difficult as finding valid and up-to-date sources of information can be difficult as there is an array of information available and not all information is relevant and trustworthy.</p>

        <h1>Week 5</h1>
        <h2>03/03/20</h2>
        <p>The learning aims of week 5 lecture was to explain, understand and identify human resource management and the ways in which is supports, develops and maintains the quality of the workforce. In addition to this, we looked at previous sample pieces for the assessment. </p>
        <p>The first 20 minutes of the lecture division of work was discussed to aid us in the developed of an organisation chart if it was not possible to locate the official organisational chart. This was beneficial for me as it highlight the different aspects that need to be included within the presentation. </p>
        <p>Throughout the lecture many aspects were highlighted in relationship to the workforce of an organisation. Human resources have the responsibility of or recruiting employees. This involves find ways to attract the right employees for the job position and ensuring that they follow the laws of discrimination to avoid controversy and other employment issues. The lecture activity I found was not challenging enough, it was to identify a job role and its salary, person and job specification and the salary. </p>

        <h1>Week 6</h1>
        <h2>10/03/20</h2>
        <p>The learning objectives for week 6 is to be able to define the foundations of leadership, identify key behaviours and personal development. </p>
        <p>The first half of the lecture investigated the importance of communication as a soft skill. During this half we participated in numerous activities that enabled us to experiment different ways of explaining topics as well as understand how different cultures communicate. I found the activities helpful as it demonstrated the different ways that people from different cultures communicate even though it may seem like they are portraying a different answer. </p>
        <p>Further from this, leadership was the focus of the rest of the lecture. I learnt about the different types of leadership and how it can be implemented in a diverse number of ways some successful and others not. Personally, this topic made me reflect on my personal skills and how I have previously applied those and future application. This was a beneficial lecture as it supported me with different perspectives of my personal development. </p>

        <h1>Week 7</h1>
        <h2>17/03/20</h2>
        <p>This week’s lecture we presented our group presentations in front of the class. The presentation was a PESTLE based on the organisation Co-operative. We were a team member down, but this did not stop us from presenting the information that we had prepared. On reflection of the presentation I think that it was successful. I ensured that my physical presentation was positive to reflect confidence which also helped with the expansion of the information on the slides. I did however, stumble on my words this was due to being slightly nervous, but I managed to regain confidence throughout the rest of the presentation. The rest of my group did extremely well and there was no feedback from the lecturer which meant that, the slides had all the information that was required. </p>
        <p>After our presentation we observed other class members to assess their performance and look at their information that was presented on their slides. </p>

        <h1>Week 8</h1>
        <h2>24/03/20</h2>
        <p>This week we have moved on to Finance and Accounting where the learning objectives are to understand the role and users of accounting and financial information and to identify the different types of organisations. </p>
        <p>I learnt that accounting is the process or work of collecting, analysing and communicating financial information and finance is the study of how individuals and organisations raise and invest funds. I previous education I studied Finance so that gave me a head start on the subject matter that was taught this week. On reflection of this I could have asked questions for more detail. </p>
        <p>There are different types of organisations, these include profit- making and not-for-profit, these definitions are self-explanatory. However, this can be split down into further categories of legal structures. Sole trader; self-employed they run their own business and keep all the profits after tax, a partnership where two or more people can set up a business and share the responsibility of funds and running the business and a limited company; is a separate entity from its owners and has certain rights and obligations.</p>

        <h1>Week 9</h1>
        <h2>31/03/20</h2>
        <p>The learning objectives this week is to understand the 3 key financial statement, identify the layout and elements and understand the uses of statement of financial position. </p>
        <p>The three types of financial statements are: statement of financial position (balance sheet), income statement (profit and loss) and cash flow statements. These statements help and support businesses at a point in time with their financial state and position. In addition to this, it allows them to monitor and record transactions. On reflection of this lecture, it was a different learning experience and adapting to this was difficult. To ensure that I remembered this information I wrote notes for the equations to ensure that I could access them easily without having to go through the slides. </p>
        <p>The activities that were used in the lecture, were very helpful as it gave me a practical understanding of the types of questions that could be in the test and that could be in a real scenario. </p>
